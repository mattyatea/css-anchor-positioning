## Browser Support

- Firefox 54+
- Chrome 51+
- Edge 79+
- Safari 10+

## Getting Started

To use the polyfill, add this script tag to your document `<head>`:

```js
<script type="module">
  if (!("anchorName" in document.documentElement.style)) {
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning");
  }
</script>
```

If you want to manually apply the polyfill, you can instead import the
`polyfill` function directly from the
`@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/dist/css-anchor-positioning-fn.js` file.

For build tools such as Vite, Webpack, and Parcel, that will look like this:

```js
import polyfill from '@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/fn';
```

The `polyfill` function returns a promise that resolves when the polyfill has
been applied.

You can view a more complete demo [here](https://anchor-polyfill.netlify.app/).

## Configuration

The polyfill supports a small number of options. When using the default version
of the polyfill that executes automatically, options can be set by setting the
value of `window.ANCHOR_POSITIONING_POLYFILL_OPTIONS`.

```js
<script type="module">
  if (!("anchorName" in document.documentElement.style)) {
    window.ANCHOR_POSITIONING_POLYFILL_OPTIONS = {
      elements: undefined,
      excludeInlineStyles: false,
      useAnimationFrame: false,
    };
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning");
  }
</script>
```

When manually applying the polyfill, options can be set by passing an object as
an argument.

```js
<script type="module">
  if (!("anchorName" in document.documentElement.style)) {
    const { default: polyfill } = await import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/dist/css-anchor-positioning-fn.js");

    polyfill({
      elements: undefined,
      excludeInlineStyles: false,
      useAnimationFrame: false,
    });
  }
</script>
```

### elements

type: `HTMLElements[]`, default: `undefined`

If set, the polyfill will only be applied to the specified elements instead of
to all styles. Any specified `<link>` and `<style>` elements will be polyfilled.
By default, all inline styles in the document will also be polyfilled, but if
`excludeInlineStyles` is true, only inline styles on specified elements will be
polyfilled.

### excludeInlineStyles

type: `boolean`, default: `false`

When not defined or set to `false`, the polyfill will be applied to all elements
that have eligible inline styles, regardless of whether the `elements` option is
defined. When set to `true`, elements with eligible inline styles listed in the
`elements` option will still be polyfilled, but no other elements in the
document will be implicitly polyfilled.

### useAnimationFrame

type: `boolean`, default: `false`

Determines whether anchor calculations should [update on every animation
frame](https://floating-ui.com/docs/autoUpdate#animationframe) (e.g. when the
anchor element is animated using `transform`s), in addition to always updating
on scroll/resize. While this option is optimized for performance, it should be
used sparingly.

For legacy support, this option can also be set by setting the value of
`window.UPDATE_ANCHOR_ON_ANIMATION_FRAME`, or, when applying the polyfill
manually, by passing a single boolean with `polyfill(true)`.

## Limitations

This polyfill was implemented against an early version of the spec, and updates
were paused to allow the syntax to solidify. Now that browsers are working on
implementation, we are in the process of bringing it up to date.

While this polyfill supports many basic use cases, it doesn't (yet) support the
following features:

- The following portions of Position Fallback:
  - `position-try-order`. If `try-size` is specified in `position-try`
    shorthand, it will be parsed, and `try-tactics` will be applied, but the
    `try-size` will be ignored.
  - The `flip-start` `try-tactic` is only partially supported. The tactic is
    only applied to property names and anchor sides.
  - a `position-area` as a `try-tactic`
  - Fallback does not support percentage anchor-side values, nor anchor
    functions that are passed through custom properties.
- Polyfill allows anchoring in scroll more permissively than the spec allows,
  for instance without a default `position-anchor`.
- `anchor-scope` property on pseudo-elements
- `position-area` property
- `anchor-center` value for `justify-self`, `align-self`, `justify-items`, and
  `align-items` properties
- anchor functions with `implicit` anchor-element
- automatic anchor positioning: anchor functions with `inside` or `outside`
  anchor-side
- `position-visibility` property
- dynamically added/removed anchors or targets
- anchors or targets in the shadow-dom
- anchors or targets in constructed stylesheets (https://github.com/oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/issues/228)
- anchor functions assigned to `inset-*` properties or `inset` shorthand
  property
- vertical/rtl writing-modes (partial support)

In addition, JS APIs like `CSSPositionTryRule` or `CSS.supports` will not be
polyfilled.
